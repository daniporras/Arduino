## First steps
How to install Arduino IDE
For all projects, I have used Arduino IDE 1.6.8 So, you can download here [a link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
The arduinos used are:
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino UNO


## Sensors
By the way all the sensors used in this projects are also known like:
- DHT22
- DHT11
- DS18B20
- LCD 16x2
- LCD 20X4
- i2c LCD
- ESP8266
- Transmitter 433 mhz
- Receiver 433 mhz
- enc28j60
- bmp180
- hc-sr4
- acs712

## Clouds
In some projects the cloud is used, like a Azure (VPS, webservices, etc) maybe you can use a home server to test it.
For example, the raspberry pi with LAMP  is perfect to save the data from our sensors.

## Projects available
- Transmiter 433 MHZ using Arduino nano and Arduino UNO
